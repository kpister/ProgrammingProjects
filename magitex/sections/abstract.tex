Magic the Gathering is a trading card game played by millions
of people across the world. The game consists of approximately 
18,000 unique cards which each have their own uses in the game.
Each year, three new sets of about 200 cards are release by the game's 
creators, Wizards of the Coast. These cards are often "spoiled"
bits at a time; only the name of a card will be revealed initially,
later that day the rest of the card will be unveiled. By harnessing
the power of deep learning neural networks, I have created a model
to predict information about a partially revealed card.
