\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

In conclusion, I was able to predict color and type with 
decent accuracy using a simple word2vec encoding of the 
card name. Adding features helped in my predictions, but 
did not make major improvements. The artwork of a card 
does not provide very much indication of the card's color 
or type, although it gives more than a random guesser. 
Finally, as would be expected, the full card image performs
above 90\% accuracy on both color and type predictions. 

\subsection{Further Work}
With more time, I would have liked to repeat many of my
initial experiments with my current knowledge: changing more
hyperparameters and cleaning the data more. I would also 
like to use my Image--Price dataset to predict what a card's 
price would be based soley on the image. If this model is 
accurate, it could be of monetary value when a new set is 
released.
