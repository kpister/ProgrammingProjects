Creating a usable dataset for my models to learn from
was by far the hardest part of this project. Initially,
I was able to work with a json file for all the card information;
the difficulties arose when using the card images. No single
site provides all 15GB of card images as a download, nor can 
you find simple a simple API to make image requests. As a result,
the images must be scraped off of gatherer.wizards.com, and cross
corrolated with the json file for information. Furthermore, I 
experimented with grabbing the prices of cards for an attempt to
predict a card's price based on the card image. THERE ARE NO GOOD 
OPTIONS FOR GETTING THE PRICE. Many card sale websites are faulty 
and do not provide full pricing information on all cards; card prices
are subject to change at a moments notice, so historical datasets are 
irrelevant and not preserved; successful card sale sites hide the prices
behind a locked API; price information is hidden in badly written html
on hard to scrape websites. Despite this, I was able to acquire the price
of 10,000 cards and attempted to run my model on the dataset. 

I DON'T KNOW IF THIS WILL SUCCEED.
